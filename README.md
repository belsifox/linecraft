Experience **Minecraft 1.21.11+** in a **3-block wide line**! Across all dimensions, blocks will only generate (and be placeable) inside the line, and that's about it.

# Requirements
- [Minecraft 1.21.11+ with Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/)
- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)

This mod is only required on the server/host or in singleplayer, it's optional on the client-side but without it blocks you attempt to place outside of the line will appear to vanish from your inventory until you relog.
